# Denton Crime Watch Shiny Dashboard
## by [Jie Tao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jie-tao-5a7a06126/)

**About the dashboard:**

This application uses Denton crime data available from the City of Denton [open data portal](https://data.cityofdenton.com/dataset). It allows users to retrieve and visualize crime data based on their choice of the 1) public address, 2) date range, and 3) crime type. Users can easily 1) identify crimes on the map, 2) figure out the number of crimes by crime type and public address from the dashboard, and 3) look up details of each crime in the data table.

**How to use:**
1. Type a street name (e.g., Fry St, Ave A, Oak St, etc...) without the street number due to privacy concern from the original data or you can simply leave it blank for crimes at all locations ;

2. Select a date range between 2019-11-06 and 2021-05-06 ;

3. Select at least one type of crime from the Crime Type box ;

4. Click on the ![search icon]();

5. Navigate to the Map tab for crime locations and click on each point for details;

6. Navigate to the Dashboard tab for the number of crimes by crime type and public address.

7. Navigate to the Data Table tab to look up details of each crime by yourself.
